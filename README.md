# GIS-data-viz

I recently enrolled in a data visualization course to increase my data science skills. The course requried us to complete two projects. The first is an illustration of surface temperature changes from 1850-2010. This [link]() showcases the final visualization adapted from the data. I hope to continue to work on this project by doing some time series analysis.
